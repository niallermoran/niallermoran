- 👋 Hi, I’m @niallermoran
- 👀 I’m interested in technology generally. Specifically I help my customers make sense of cloud and define their cloud journies. I love solution architecture and don't code nearly as much as I would like.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create Node.js APIs that interact with Azure services and consuming said APIs using a React web page. I no longer build production systems but I love learning new coding languages and frameworks.
- 💞️ I would love to contribute to an opensource project that's not mine.
